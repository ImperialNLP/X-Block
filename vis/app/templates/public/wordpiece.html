        <h1>Multimodal Hate Speech Detection - About Wordpieces</h1>
        <p>When analyzing text, the first thing we do is to split it up into 'tokens'.</p>
        <p>Often these tokens are words and punctuation, but sometimes for rarer or misspelt words, we may split these words up into 'wordpieces' that are just components of these words.</p>
        <p>Whenever a token in a text visualization starts with ' - -' it indicates that it was once part of a larger word that has been split up.</p>
